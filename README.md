<h1>KNN Undersampling</h1>

This project contains the implementation of KNN Undersampling method in several languages, as proposed in the original paper.

<p>Abstract</p>
In supervised learning, the imbalanced number of instances among the classes in a dataset can
make the algorithms to classify one instance from the minority class as one from the majority class.
With the aim to solve this problem, the KNN algorithm provides a basis to other balancing methods.
These balancing methods are revisited in this work, and a new and simple approach of KNN
undersampling is proposed. The experiments demonstrated that the KNN undersampling method
outperformed other sampling methods. The proposed method also outperformed the results of
other studies, and indicates that the simplicity of KNN can be used as a base for efficient algorithms
in machine learning and knowledge discovery.
